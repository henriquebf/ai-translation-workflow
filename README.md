**Features:**

- Generates any missing text from Sorce to Target locale files.
- Removes obsolete text in Target locale files when removed in Source.

ðŸ’¡ When you change a text that already exists in target locale files, those are intentionally **not** translated. In case you wish to apply those translations, please manually remove the corresponding texts from target locale files.

## Usage

- Add your source translation json file into a locales folder. E.g. `locales/en.json`
- Update `.github/workflows/translate.yml` file with your settings:
  1. In `SOURCE_LANG`, add your source language locale that represents the translation file above.
  2. In `TARGET_LANGS`, add a `CSV` list of the target locales of the languages you wish to generate translations.
  3. If your `locales` folder is not placed in the root of your repository, update `LOCALES_ROOT_PATH` that represents where this folder is locales. E.g. If your locale files are in **web/src/locales/en.json**, write `web/src`.
